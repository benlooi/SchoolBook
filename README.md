# SchoolBook
A social network for school.

This is an introductory coding project for students learning to code.

Social networks are here to stay, and schools may want their own private and monitored social network for
educational purpose. 
Infocomm Club students can volunteer their service for this community project to build a social network portal for 
internal use.
It will be built from scratch, i.e., no pre-built CMS like Buddypress etc, as the main aim is to give
students the opportunity to code instead of using ready-made boilerplates.

Through this project, students can learn about user experience design, database, and other essential computational thinking skills.
 They also learn about project management and collaboration using tools like npm, Github, bower etc.

Instructors are to hand-hold and scaffold the students, and mentor them. This repository helps kickstart and provide the 
bare-bone initial structure to begin brain-storming and planning. Students can then fork their own versions.

This is open-source and you can do whatever you want with it.
